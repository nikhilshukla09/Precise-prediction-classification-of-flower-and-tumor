PRECISE PREDICTION: CLASSIFICATION OF FLOWER AND TUMOR
 PROJECT OVERVIEW

Precise Prediction is a machine learning–based classification project focused on accurate prediction using Logistic Regression.
The project addresses two real-world problems:

🌸 Flower Classification – Predicting flower species

🧠 Tumor Classification – Classifying tumors as Benign or Malignant

The project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline including data preprocessing, EDA, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

🎯 OBJECTIVES

Build classification models using Logistic Regression

Apply supervised machine learning techniques on real datasets

Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

Develop an end-to-end academic major project

🖥️ WEB APPLICATION PREVIEW

⚙️ MACHINE LEARNING MODEL USED
Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is used due to its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness for both binary and multi-class classification problems.

📈 MODEL EVALUATION METRICS

The model performance is evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

Confusion Matrix

🧾 USER CSV UPLOAD & BATCH PREDICTION FEATURE

This project includes a batch prediction feature that allows users to upload their own CSV files for automated analysis and classification.

Supported Predictions

🧠 Tumor Classification: Benign or Malignant

🌸 Iris Flower Classification: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

How It Works

The user uploads a CSV file through the web interface

The system validates the CSV structure and required features

The trained Logistic Regression model processes all rows

Predictions are generated for each record

Results are displayed instantly in tabular form

CSV Requirements

The CSV file must contain all required feature columns

Column names must exactly match the trained model features

Each row represents one data sample

Benefits

No manual data entry required

Supports bulk analysis (batch prediction)

User-friendly and beginner-friendly interface

✅ RESULTS

Achieved high accuracy using Logistic Regression

Successfully classified flower species and tumor types

Model generalized well on unseen test data

📘 KEY LEARNINGS

Practical understanding of Logistic Regression

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Evaluation of classification models

Building professional academic ML projects
